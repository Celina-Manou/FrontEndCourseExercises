	<h2>
		<a name="Intro"><strong>Introduction</strong></a>
	</h2>
	<p>We use internet everyday to entertain ourselves, communicate or learn. But, did we ever wondered what happens
		behind the scenes? How does internet really work? As long you are here i assume you joined the group of
		"Wonderers".</p>
	<p>In this article, we will try to briefly explain and have a good understanding on how infrastructure and
		technologies behind the scenes, make the Internet work. More information and depth on the specific topic can be
		found at the resources section at the end of this article.</p>
	<p><strong>Let's start!</strong></p>

	<h2>
		<a name="Hardware"><strong>Hardware</strong></a>
	</h2>
	<p>One of Internet's main components is Hardware. When we refer to hardware we include everything from the cables
		that carry terabits of information every second to your computer to radios, smartphones, routers, servers,
		satellites, and other devices.</p>

	<p>All these devices together create the network of networks.</p>
	<p>Inside this network we can find two types of elements. From one hand we have the static ones;machines that hold
		all the information anyone can search for on the internet and are called <strong>Servers</strong>.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, it's us; Through our computer, smartphone or any other device we use to connect to the
		internet, we ask for the information stored in the servers. This is why our devices' position is described as an
		end-point and are called <strong>Clients</strong>.</p>
	<p>Other elements are nodes. They act as a point of connection within a network. It is an environment where all
		devices are accessible through the network. And then there are the transmission lines which can be physical
		(cables and fiber optics) or they can be wireless signals from satellites, cell phone or 4G towers, or radios.
	</p>
	<p>Ok, until now we know the basic concept on which internet is based on; the server-client information's exchange
		relationship. But how do we achieve this connection? How do we make this hardware work for us? How are we able
		to approach the information we are looking for that is stored in a server?</p>
	<p>Here come the <strong>Protocols</strong>. Protocols are sets of rules that machines follow to complete tasks.
		Without them, the communication between devices and machines couldn't happen. The machines would not be able to
		understand one another or distribute the information in a meaningful way to the client. The protocols guide the
		machines by providing them with the necessary method and a common language to use and finally be able to
		transmit data.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="Internet_Protocols"><strong>Internet Protocols</strong></a>
	</h2>
	<p>Let's take, now, a closer look on protocols. As we saw, protocols establish the rules for how information passes
		through the Internet. Otherwise, we would need direct connections to other computers to access the information
		they hold. We'd also have to make both our computer and the target computer understand a common language.</p>
	<p>Two of the most important protocols are the <strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</strong> and the
		<strong>Internet Protocol (IP)</strong>. Often grouped together as TCP/IP. If we use an FTP server, we
		automatically rely on the file transfer protocol. There is also <strong>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</strong>
		which is a connectionless protocol. It speeds up communications as it does not necessarily acquire a connection
		before data is transferred. This allows data to 'travel' very quickly. Despite high speed though, there are more
		chances for a packet to become lost in transit. Last but not least, you have seen <strong>hypertext transfer
			protocol (HTTP)</strong>. This is the protocol we use to view Web sites through a browser.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="IP_Addresses"><strong>IP Addresses</strong></a>
	</h2>
	<p>Let's zoom in a bit more and focus specifically on what IP Addresses are. Each device connected to the Internet
		has an IP address. Think of it like our unique cellphone number. This is how one machine can detect another
		through the massive network.</p>
	<p>The version of IP we mostly use today is IPv4, which is based on a 32-bit address system. But seems not to be
		enough as We're running out of addresses. That's why, back in 1991, the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF)
		decided that it was almost obligatory to develop a new version of IP to meet demand in addresses. As a result
		IPv6 arised; a 128-bit address system, capable to cover the demand's needs with the necessary number of IPs.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="DNS"><strong>DNS</strong></a>
	</h2>
	<p>Let's, now, observe this journey (and hopefully enjoy it). What do we do to send a message or retrieve
		information from another computer? We saw that TCP/IP protocols are essential to allow this transition to
		happen. So the journey begins with our request going out over the network. This request hits domain name servers
		(DNS) until it finds the target server that hold the information we are looking for. The DNS guides the request
		to the right direction. As soon as the target server receives the request, it sends a response back to our
		computer. Though, the way back might not be the same as the first one. Data can follow a completely different
		path to get back to us; the one with the least 'resistance'.</p>
	<h2>
		<a name="Packets(TCP/UDP)"><strong>Packets (TCP/UDP)</strong></a>
	</h2>
	<p>vFine, we saw the necessary process that must be followed so that the data get back to us. What happens next?
		What do we actually get and from who? As soon as the request will go to the Web server, it will respond by
		sending the requested file in a series of <strong>Packets</strong>. When we say Packets we refer to parts of a
		file that range between 1,000 and 1,500 bytes. Each packet contains part of the body of your message. So,
		similarly to a real-life package, each packet includes a source and destination along with the data being
		transferred. Packets contain headers and footers that tell computers what's in the packet and point the
		direction in which the information needed to complete the file can be found and retrieved. Each packet travels
		through the network and down to our computer.</p>

	<p> We conclude that packets can travel multiple paths to get to their destination, it's possible for information to
		route around congested areas on the Internet. In fact, as long as some connections remain, entire sections of
		the Internet could go down and information could still travel from one section to another.</p>

	<p>When the packets get to us, our device arranges them according to the rules of the protocols and finally we get
		what we asked for</p>

	<p>Seems like a long journey, right? But yet fascinating and quick.</p>

	<p> To adapt this knowledge we can think of an everyday example. What exactly happens when we send an e-mail or we
		get a phone call over the Internet? We now can say that both get broken into packets and start their journey
		across the Internet.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="HTTP:Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"><strong>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong></a>
	</h2>
	<p>Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989. Development of early HTTP Requests for
		Comments (RFCs) was a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web
		Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.</p>

	<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web pages
		using hypertext links, transmiitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. HTTP functions as a request–response
		protocol in the client–server computing model. It is an application layer protocol for distributed,
		collaborative, hypermedia information systems.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="HTML:Hypertext_Markup_Language"><strong>HTML: Hypertext Markup Language</strong></a>
	</h2>

	<p>First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language.</p>


	<p>HTML is used to create electronic documents. It is a formatting system for displaying material retrieved over the
		Internet. In other words, is the language used to create webpages. "Hypertext" refers to the hyperlinks that an
		HTML page may contain. "Markup language" refers to the way tags are used to define the page layout and elements
		within the page.</p>
	<p>
		HTML provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its
		appearance.
	</p>
	<h2>
		<a name="Routers"><strong>Routers</strong></a>
	</h2>
	<p>A router is a networking (physical or virtual) internetworking device that is designed to receive, analyze, and
		forward data packets between computer networks. It “routes” traffic between the devices and the internet. Data
		sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets. </p>

	<p> Router analyzes a destination IP address of a given packet header and compares it with the routing table to
		decide the packet's next path. The list of routing tables provides directions to transfer the data to a
		particular network destination. They have a set of rules that compute the best path to forward the data to the
		given IP address.</p>

	<p>Routers use a modem such as a cable, fiber, or DSL modem to allow communication between other devices and the
		internet. Most of the routers have several ports to connect different devices to the internet at the same time.
		It uses the routing tables to determine where to send data and from where the traffic is coming.</p>

	<p>Router types are: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>The <strong>Wireless (Wi-Fi) router</strong>.
			Wireless routers provide Wi-Fi access to smartphones, laptops, and other devices with Wi-Fi network
			capabilities. Also, they may provide standard Ethernet routing for a small number of wired network devices.
			Some Wi-Fi routers can act as a combination router and modem, converting an incoming broadband signal from
			your ISP.</li>

		<li><strong>The Brouter</strong>.
			Short for bridge router, a brouter is a networking device that serves as both a bridge and a router.</li>

		<li><strong>The Core router</strong>.
			A core router is a router in a computer network that routes data within a network, but not between networks.
		</li>

		<li><strong>The Edge router</strong>.
			The term edge device refers to any apparatus that acts as an entry point into the core of the network. An
			edge device acts as a checkpoint at the border between two countries. When data attempts to enter the
			network, it is inspected according to certain security procedures, and either allowed or denied entry.</li>

		<li><strong>The Virtual router</strong>.
			A virtual router is a backup router used in a Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) setup. This is a
			protocol used with routers to help prevent network downtime.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Now that we covered the basics and briefly explained the way infrastructure and technologies in the background
		commit to make the internet work, i hope you find yourself more excited when you take any online action while
		noticing what is going on behind the scenes. In any way, we should notice, observe, get to know and admire
		something and thw way it operates so that we feel grateful for having it. And the truth is, after writing this
		article, i feel more grateful for being able to enjoy Internet's capabilities and potentials! See ya
		"Wonderers".</p>
